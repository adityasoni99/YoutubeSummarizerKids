            <h3>Implementing a Map-Reduce Design Pattern for Efficient Summarization</h3>
            <p>Imagine you have a big box of LEGOs, all mixed up!  To build something cool, you first sort the LEGOs into different color piles (that's like 'map'). Then, you build something awesome with each color pile separately (that's like 'reduce'). Finally, you put all your awesome creations together!  That's like how computers make summaries – they sort the information into topics, then summarize each topic, and then put all the summaries together!</p>

                <div class="question">Q: Why do we use map and reduce for summaries?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: It's like having lots of friends help you build a big LEGO city!  Each friend builds a part (map), and then you put all the parts together (reduce) to make an amazing city – a super awesome summary!</div>
