            <h3>Navigating the AI Job Market</h3>
            <p>Imagine a big playground with three different areas!  One area has cool new toys built from LEGOs (those are the 'product companies'). Another area has the people who make the special LEGO bricks (those are the 'infrastructure companies'). And the last area has the people who design the awesome instructions for building the best LEGO creations (those are the 'model companies').  This video is about someone who looked for a job in this amazing AI playground and learned about all the different parts of it! They learned that finding a job is like finding the perfect LEGO set – there are lots of choices, but some are more fun than others!</p>
