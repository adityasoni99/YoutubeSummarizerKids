            <h3>Creating Import and Export Structures</h3>
            <p>Imagine you're building with LEGOs!  We're making special LEGO boxes. One box is for the LEGOs you put IN (that's importing), and another box is for the LEGOs you take OUT (that's exporting).  We're making these boxes so we can easily build amazing things with our LEGOs!  These special boxes help us keep our LEGOs organized and make building super fun and easy.</p>

            <h3>Creating and Enabling Remote Function Modules</h3>
            <p>Imagine you have LEGO blocks, and you want to build a really cool castle, but some of the blocks are in a different room!  This is like a remote function module.  It's a special set of instructions (like a LEGO instruction booklet) that tells the computer how to build something, but those instructions are in a different part of the computer. We make sure it can share its instructions so we can use the blocks from the other room to finish our castle!</p>

            <div class="qa">
                <div class="question">Q: What is a remote function module like?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: It's like a special phone call between different parts of a computer!  One part asks for help building something, and another part sends back the instructions to build it.  It's like asking your friend for help building a LEGO castle, but your friend is in another room!</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa">
                <div class="question">Q: Why do we need to 'enable' it?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: Enabling it is like making sure the phone is turned on and the line is clear! We have to make sure the computer parts can talk to each other properly so they can share the LEGO instructions and build the castle together.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa">
                <div class="question">Q: What happens if we don't enable it?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: If we don't enable it, it's like the phone is off – no one can talk!  The different parts of the computer can't share the building instructions, and we can't build our LEGO castle.</div>

            <h3>Creating Business Objects (BOs)</h3>
            <p>Imagine you're building with LEGOs!  Business Objects (BOs) are like special LEGO instructions.  We use a computer program to create these instructions so we can build something bigger and better.  We take other instructions (like from a special recipe, called an RFC) and add them to our BO instructions to make our LEGO creation even more amazing! Then, we can share these instructions with others so they can build the same thing.</p>

            <h3>Integrating Function Modules into Business Objects</h3>
            <p>Imagine you're building with LEGOs!  Business objects are like big LEGO structures, and function modules are like special LEGO pieces that do cool things.  We're learning how to put those special pieces into our big LEGO structure to make it even better!  It's like adding a super-powered engine to a LEGO car!</p>

            <h3>Using BAPIs with Non-SAP Systems</h3>
            <p>Imagine you have a special box (a BAPI) that holds toys.  You can share this box with your friends who don't have the same toy boxes (other computer systems). You can put some toys in (import) and get some toys out (export). Grown-ups use these special boxes to share information between different computer systems, like sharing LEGOs between different houses!</p>

            <div class="qa">
                <div class="question">Q: Why do grown-ups use these special boxes?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: Because it's easier to share information between different computer systems than to try and deliver the toys one by one! It's like sharing a whole box of LEGOs instead of moving each one separately.</div>
